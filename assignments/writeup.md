   - Introduction: What is your species? Why is it important? What are some of the management, industry, or conservation decisions that could benefit from a forecast?

   - Modeling: Go through your approach and results, including a projection to future climate conditions. It’s okay to include challenges you’re facing or unanswered questions. These can inform our discussion.
   - Implications: How does your prediction influence the decisions around this species that you discussed in the introduction?
 - Refer to the "Forecast Cards" questions we used to guide our discussions
